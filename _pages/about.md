### About me

I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Chicago. I am completing a joint master degree in CS at the same time, and I am fortunate to be advised by Lorenzo Orecchia.

I am interested in theoretical computer science. The specific fields of interest to me are the design of approximation algorithms, and the interplay between combinatorics, graph theory, and computational complexity.

I enjoy competitive programming and puzzle solving.
