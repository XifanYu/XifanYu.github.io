### About me

I am a 4th year PhD student in computer science at Yale University and I am fortunate to be advised by Dan Spielman. Before then, I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, advised by Lorenzo Orecchia.

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. Recently I am interested in graph theory, average-case complexity, Sum-of-Squares algorithms, and high-dimensional statistics.

Previously, I participated in competitive programming. I am a GO player, and I was a member of UChicago GO Team.

Here is my [**CV**](https://xifanyu.github.io/files/CV-25-02.pdf).
