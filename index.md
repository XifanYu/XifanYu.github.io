I am interested in theoretical computer science. The specific areas of interest to me are the design of approximation algorithms, and the interplay between combinatorics, graph theory, and computational complexity.
I am currently a senior undergraduate student at University of Chicago. I am completing a joint master degree under the supervision of Lorenzo Orecchia at the same time. 




## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/XifanYu/xifan.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/XifanYu/xifan.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
